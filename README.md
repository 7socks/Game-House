# Game House

Created in August 2021 as part of a self-enrichment exercise to learn C++.

## Description

Under the working title 'casino game', this simple game does not feature any recognizable casino games. It is played via the command line.

The game features a number of NPC characters, each of which have their own skill stats and games they can join.
Keep an eye on how they behave in certain games--it just might give you an advantage!

**Coin Flip**: Simply guess heads or tails. The prize amount decreases based on the number of players who guessed correctly.

**Gamble Pot**: Each player places a bet amount, then guesses the total prize amount of the pot. 
The goal is to guess as close as possible to maximize your prize, but if you guess higher than the pot, you lose!

**Zener Cards**: Each turn, one player draws a card, and the other players guess the symbol and color of the card. 
On your own turn, you can predict the other players' guesses for additional prize gold.

**Fishing Hole**: Cast your line and hope you land a big one! Trade in your catch at the rewards booth. Rarer "fish" are worth more. 
While you're at it, laugh at my awful attempts at humorous item names.

## Set-up
Download or clone this repo to your local machine and run it in your GUI of choice.

If you're curious enough to play this for yourself, be aware that the code is by no means polished and has not been fully tested for bugs. 
That aside, it might be amusing enough to hold your attention for ten minutes or so.
