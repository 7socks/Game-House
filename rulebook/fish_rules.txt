FISHING HOLE RULES

1. Basic Play
The Fishing Hole is a simple game that doesn't require any skill to play.
Simply cast your line into the "water" and see if anything bites! You can reel 
in all kinds of prizes, and some are more rare than others. See what you can
collect!

2. Bribes
When you hook something, you have the opportunity to throw a bribe into the
"water". This can increase your chances of successfully reeling something in, 
but keep in mind that rarer items require higher bribes to make a difference.
Tip: You can enter 0 when prompted if you change your mind or don't have any
gold to give.

3. Your Basket
You can see what items you've collected by checking your Basket at the
Fishing Hole or Kiosk.

4. Rewards Booth
Access the rewards booth from the Kiosk to exchange your fishing items for 
gold. Rarer items will fetch a better price...but rumor has it there are some
items that will bring you good luck if you keep them!
