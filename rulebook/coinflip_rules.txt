COIN FLIP GAME RULES

1. Game Structure
The game consists of one simple round of guessing. Choose either HEADS or TAILS
when prompted, and then place your bet. There is no maximum bet for Coin Flip.

2. Winnings
The calculation of winnings is fairly complicated behind the scenes, but the
only thing you need to worry about is the number of players. When there are 
more players at the table, the potential prize payout is higher. However, when
multiple people correctly guess the result, the payout is sharply reduced.
