ZENER CARD GAME RULES

1. Game Structure
Each round consists of two parts, the dealer's turn and the players' turns.
On the dealer's turn, the dealer draws a hidden ZENER card, and each player
must predict the color and shape of the symbol on that card. Once you have made 
your prediction, you are asked to place a bet. The maximum bet is 1000 gold.

2. Predicting the Card
There are 25 unique ZENER cards in the deck. The symbol on each card has a
color (BLACK, RED, GREEN, BLUE, or YELLOW) and a shape (CIRCLE, SQUARE, CROSS,
WAVES, or STAR). The deck is re-shuffled after each turn, so the same card can
appear more than once in the same game.

3. The Dealer's Turn
While the dealer is distracted, you can attempt to peek at one other player's
prediction before you place your bet! You have a chance of seeing their 
predicted color, shape, or both. But if you get caught, you must pay a penalty
of up to 50 gold.

4. Your Turn
On your turn, you draw the card for the other players to predict. You can win a
bonus if you correctly predict the accuracy of the other players' answers.
15 gold		  Incorrect color and shape
30 gold		  Correct color or shape (but not both)
100 gold	  Correct color AND shape

5. Winnings
You win an amount based on the accuracy of your prediction:
2x your bet   Color or shape
5x your bet   Both color and shape
