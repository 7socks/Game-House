GAMBLING POT RULES

1. Game Structure
At the start of the round, each player places a hidden bet into the pot. The
players then guess the total amount of gold in the pot. The goal is to guess a
number closest to the actual size, but not over! You have a chance to leave the
game at the end of each round.

2. Placing Bets
Each round has a maximum stake which limits the amount of gold you and other
players can put in the pot. On the first round, the maximum stake is always
10 gold. On the next round, the maximum stake is equal to the size of the pot
in the previous round.

3. Winnings
If your guess is higher than the size of the pot, you don't win anything and
forfeit your bet. The player that guesses the amount closest to the pot size
without going over receives a prize equal to their guess. The remaining gold
is split between any other players who didn't overestimate the pot. If you 
guess the size of the pot exactly, you win the entire pot!
